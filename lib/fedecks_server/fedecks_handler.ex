defmodule FedecksServer.FedecksHandler do
  @moduledoc """
  Behaviour that should be implemented for handling authentication and communcication over a Fedecks
  Websocket.

  Requires a keyword-list configuration value
  keyed by the OTP app name, returned by the `otp_app/0` callback and the  module name, which returns a
  keyword list with the keys:

  * `secret` used to encode and sign an authentication token
  * `salt` also used to encode and sign and authentication token
  * (optional) `token_refresh_millis` - how often the token is refreshed and sent to the client, in
    milliseconds. The default is 3 hours
  * `token_expiry_secs` - how many seconds before a token expires. The default is 4 weeks.

  For example, an handle called `MyApp.MyHandler` with an application name `:my_app` may have the following
  configuration set

  ```elixir
  config :my_app, MyAppHandler,
    secret: "ULO1b5eiGSPNcrnAvnIXGy7JhH0WorbLkVq/pT10V/0/Hq7Dw66A5XIbZT0X6zq4",
    salt: "b/BuhKLXOIqYM8sD53XnT51gwiBHmBpv+eM5I6HrvERTleoIq0EHYi76aNo+PP5E",
    token_refresh_millis: :timer.minutes(30),
    token_expiry_secs: 360
  ```
